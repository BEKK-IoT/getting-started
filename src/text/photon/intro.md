# Photon

The Photon is a $19 tiny micro-controller with a Wi-Fi development kit for creating connected projects.
Today Photon is thought by many as **THE** product to use for creating devices for the Internet of Things.
Netflix has even created a [*"Netflix button"*](http://makeit.netflix.com/the-switch) by using a Photon.
It's small, it's powerful, It's easy to use and it's connected to the cloud.
