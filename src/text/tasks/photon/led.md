# The Magic led!

![Led](https://www.arduino.cc/en/uploads/Tutorial/ExampleCircuit_bb.png)

Ignore that it is a arduino that is the example, focus on the pins.
They are the same on the photon!

- Turn the led on if someone sends an event on "greet" with msg "hello".
- Turn the led off if someone sends an event on "greet" with msg "bye"
